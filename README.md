# james_password_generator

Challenge to create a random password generator.
Took longer than I thought it should because of the different arrays and strings.
Had to link them together for it to work. 
For the longest time I could only get it to generate numbers.
No upper and lowercase letters, numbers or special characters.
Then was giveing me too many number. Either 6 or 9 too many.
Once figured out the problem it gave everything I wanted and the correct ammount
